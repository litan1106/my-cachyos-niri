# Install the Hongguo (红果短剧) desktop app -- 100% NATIVE, no Wine/Proton.
#
# Hongguo ships only as a Windows installer, but it's just an NSIS self-extracting
# archive, and nothing in the app that matters is actually Windows-bound (see
# docs/scripts-guide.md for the full investigation). So instead of running the
# setup.exe under Wine, we UNPACK it with 7z and keep only the app's Python
# backend + Java signer jar (discarding the bundled Windows python/ and jre/).
# launch-hongguo then runs that backend on a native Python venv, with the signer
# on the host JVM, and opens the UI in a native browser.
#
# The installer is a versioned NSIS build (hongguo-<ver>-windows-x86_64-setup.exe),
# not a stable vendor URL, so the download link is pinned below and overridable
# with $HONGGUO_INSTALLER_URL.

cat <<EOF

Hongguo is installed (natively — no Wine). Find it in your app launcher, or run:

  launch-hongguo

The first launch installs the backend's Python deps into a venv using your
system Python (one-time); later runs start in about a second. The UI opens in a
native browser (the Windows WebView2 UI is not used). To update later, delete the
cached installer and re-run this script with a newer \$HONGGUO_INSTALLER_URL.

(Re-login once so the app launcher and new terminals see ~/.local/bin.)
